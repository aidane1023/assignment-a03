/*
Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on these rules:
A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.
Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its argument and returns a value
you can evaluate to determine the password strength.
Do not have the function return a stringâ€”you may need to support multiple languages in the future.
Use a single output statement.
