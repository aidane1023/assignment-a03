/*
Write a program that will help you determine how many months it will take to pay off a credit card balance.
The program should ask the user to enter the balance of a credit card, the APR of the card, and their monthly payment.
The program should then return the number of months needed (rounded up to the next integer value).
The formula for this is: n = -(1/30) * log(1 + b/p * (1 - (1 + i)^30)) / log(1 + i)

Prompt for the cardâ€™s APR. Do the division internally.
Prompt for the APR as a percentage, not a decimal.
Use a class called PaymentCalculator with a public method called calculateMonthsUntilPaidOff, which returns the number of months.
Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent.
